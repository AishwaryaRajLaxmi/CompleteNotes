#DataTypes:
-----------

->In programming, data types is an important concept.

->To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the type.

 example:
    let x=16 + "Volvo"; //it does not make any sense adding a number with string but javascript will treat it as given below:
      let x = "16" + "Volvo";
      //output:16Volvo

      let x = 16 + 4 + "Volvo";
      //output=20Volvo

      ->In the first example, JavaScript treats 16 and 4 as numbers, until it reaches "Volvo".

     ->In the second example, since the first operand is a string, all operands are treated as strings.

#Note:-When adding a number and a string, JavaScript will treat the number as a string.

#JavaScript Types are Dynamic
->JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types

->Javascript is a dynamic typing language. When we declare a variable, we do not need to specify what type this variable is. Javascript engine infers what type this variable is based on the value assigned to at run time.
  
  let x;           // Now x is undefined
  x = 5;           // Now x is a Number
  x = "John";      // Now x is a String
 

 #VALUE
  -->1.Primitive
     example:
       let firstName='jonas';
       let age=20;

  -->2.Object
        let me ={
        name : 'jonas'
       };

#JavaScript has different data types, primitive and non-primitive. There are seven primitive data types, Number, String, Boolean, NULL, Undefined and Symbol and one non-primitive data type ‘object’.

 1.Number:-Floating point numbers -> Used decimals and integers 
  let age=23;

2.String:Sequence of Characters -> Used for text
  let name='Tanu';

3.Boolean:Logical type that can only be true or false -> Used for taking decisions it returns only true or false
  let age=true;

4.Undefined:Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined.The variable is declared but doesn’t contain any value.
  var a;
  console.log(a); // This will return undefined.
  
5.Null:The null in JavaScript is a data type that is represented by only one value, the ‘null’ itself. A null value means no value.

   var a = null;
   console.log(a);

   ->If we check the data type of a using the typeof operator, we get:

    example:
     typeof(a);         // This returns object
     This means the type of a null value is an object, not null.

6.Symbol(ES2015):Value that is unique and cannot be changed(Not useful for now)

7.BigInt(ES2020):Larger integers than the Number type can hold

 Note:Js has dynamic typing we don't have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable.instead data types are determined automatically.
