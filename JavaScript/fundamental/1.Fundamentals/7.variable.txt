// How to create variables:
var x;
let y;

// How to use variables:
x = 5;
y = 6;
let z = x + y;

->The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:

1.Fixed values
2.Variable values

->Fixed values are called Literals.

->Variable values are called Variables.


#Variables:-
-----------
->Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).

->In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:

           var x = 5;
           var y = 6;
           var z = x + y;

There 4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:-
-------------------------------------------------

 ->var keyword is used in old javascript but it Doesn't remove from till now

 ->The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

 ->The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015

 ->The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).

->Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.

->Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.

->Variables defined with let have Block Scope.

 ->The const is using for making the variable that it's value will be fixed in entire program and we can't change it

 ->Eventhough we create and declare directly by variable name without using any extra keyword

1.Using var
   var x = 5;
   var y = 30;

2.Using let

   let x = 5;
   let y = 6;
   let z = x + y;

3.Using const

const price1 = 5;
const price2 = 6;
let total = price1+ price2;

4.Using nothing
 x=10;
 y=20;

===========================================================
when we need to print something we use console.log() statement

 let js="amazing";
 console.log(js);
 //output:amazing

 console.log('jonas');
 //output:jonas


let myFirstjob = 'Programmer';
let myCurrentjob = 'teacher';
let 3var = 'tanu'; //error

->In javascript we can only start the vaiable name by using alphabet,dollar($) and underscore symbol

->also variable name could be alphanumeric
   let abc4 = 10;

->Special symbol and predefined keyword are not allowed in js to creating variable

->Variable name should be meaningful
 let name = 'Tanu';
 let value = 40;
