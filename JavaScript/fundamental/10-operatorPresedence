#Operator Presedence: Operator precedence describes the order in which operations are performed in an arithmetic expression.

Multiplication (*) and division (/) have higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).


++	Increment	1	R -> L
—	Decrement	1	R -> L
—	Negation	1	R -> L
!	NOT	1	R -> L
*, /, %	Multiplication, division, modulus	2	L -> R
+, —	Addition, subtraction	3	L -> R
+	Concatenation	3	L -> R
<, <=	Less than, less than, or equal	4	L -> R
>, >=	Greater than, greater than, or equal	4	L -> R
==	Equal	5	L -> R
!=	Not equal	5	L -> R
===	Identity	5	L -> R
!==	Non-identity	5	L -> R
&&	AND	6	L -> R
||	OR	6	L -> R
?:	Ternary	7	R -> L
=	Assignment	8	R -> L
+=, -=, and so on.	Arithmetic assignment	8	R -> L
