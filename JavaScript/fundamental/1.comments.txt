Comments:-
----------
->JavaScript comments can be used to explain JavaScript code, and to make it more readable.

->JavaScript comments can also be used to prevent execution, when testing alternative code.

->There are two ways to comment any statement

1.Single line comment: Single line comments start with //.

->Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).

   let x = 5;      // Declare x, give it the value of 5
let y = x + 2;  // Declare y, give it the value of x + 2

2.Multiline Comment: Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */.

->Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by JavaScript

/*
The code below will change
the heading with id = "myH"
and the paragraph with id = "myP"
in my web page:
*/
document.getElementById("myH").innerHTML = "My First Page";

->typeof is a keyword that will show that which datatype of of your value belongs to
   let jsfun = true;
   let a = 40;

   console.log(typeof true); //output: Boolean
     console.log(typeof 23); //output: Number
